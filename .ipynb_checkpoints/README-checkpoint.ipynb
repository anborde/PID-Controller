    "\n",
    "* The parameters of PID controller have been trained by Twiddle algorithm and have been fine tuned by some manual adjustments.\n",
    "* In order to run the Twiddle across the entire track is a time and resource consuming process hence we ran the simulator for 1000 steps and fed the error recorded to Twiddle algorithm to optimize the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* With 0.2 as tolerance, we obtained (0.1, 0, 1.82898) as the parameters from the Twidle algorithm. We fine tuned these values to **(0.12, 0, 1.982898)** which provided a satisfactory result.\n",

    "**P - component effect**\n",
    "- To study the effect of Propotional component on the bearing of the car we will run the PID project by setting the value of propotional component parameter to 0 and retaining the other values.\n",
    "- As seen in the video [PID Without P Component](https://youtu.be/QEu23lkjXe0), the absense of Propotional component reduces the sensitivity of the car to curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I - component effect**\n",
    "- As it is mentioned above that the value of I parameter in optimized values is 0, we can conclude that Integral component has the minimum effect on deciding the bearing of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D - component effect**\n",
    "- To study the effect of Differential component on the bearing of the car we will run the PID controller by setting the value of differential component parameter to 0 and retaining the other values.\n",
    "- As seen in the video [PID Without D Component](https://youtu.be/C_iVKEg9_Rk), tough our car is sensitive to curves, there is considerable loss in the stability of the car and car makes sharp turns from one side of the road to the other.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "- In conclusion we can say that the propotional component helps in providing sensitivity to the curvature of the road as it is directly linked with the cross track error.\n",
    "- Similarily, differential component helps to ease the oscillations of the car by counter steering the car as the error reduces over time.\n",
    "- Integral component is like the correctional component for the PID controller and hence it has the least value in the optimized values of PID parameters.\n",
    "- A right combination of P, I and D provides a smooth control over the car.\n",
    "- But, if we increase the speed of the car, it becomes difficult to control the car with the same parameters. Hence, along with the steering of the car, the throttle needs to be controlled in order to control the car in an orderly manner."
